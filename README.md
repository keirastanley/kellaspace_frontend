# kellaspace

A mobile-first site for my best friend and I to stay connected.

## Current build

[Link to vercel deployment](https://kellaspace-frontend.vercel.app/) - ⚠️ The site is usable on all devices but most **optimised for smaller screens**. I will be implementing proper desktop designs once the mobile site is fully functional.
